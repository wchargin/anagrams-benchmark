The English and Greek word lists are standard Scrabble word lists for
these two languages. I couldnâ€™t find a word list for a language
contained outside the BMP, so I synthesized a Phoenician word list by
transliterating the Greek word list into the Phoenician script.

Specifically, `phoenician.txt` was created by running the Python 3
script in `create_phoenician.py` in this directory:

    python3 create_phoenician.py
